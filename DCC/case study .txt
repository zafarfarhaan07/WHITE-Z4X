Step 1: Input User Details

Accept user input for:

Age (years)

Weight (kg)

Height (cm)

Gender (Male/Female)

Activity Level (Sedentary, Lightly Active, Moderately Active, Very Active, Super Active)

Step 2: Calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

Use the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:

For Men:

BMR = (10 × Weight) + (6.25 × Height) - (5 × Age) + 5

For Women:

BMR = (10 × Weight) + (6.25 × Height) - (5 × Age) - 161

Step 3: Calculate Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)

Multiply BMR by an activity factor based on the user’s lifestyle:

Activity Level

Factor

Sedentary (little to no exercise)

1.2

Lightly active (1-3 days/week)

1.375

Moderately active (3-5 days/week)

1.55

Very active (6-7 days/week)

1.725

Super active (athlete level)

1.9

TDEE = BMR × Activity Factor

Step 4: Apply Calorie Deficit or Surplus

For Weight Loss: Reduce calories (Calorie Deficit)

500 kcal/day deficit → ~0.5 kg weight loss per week

1000 kcal/day deficit → ~1 kg weight loss per week

Target Calories = TDEE - Deficit

For Weight Gain: Increase calories (Calorie Surplus)

Add 250-500 kcal/day for gradual weight gain

Step 5: Output Result

Display the final recommended daily calorie intake based on the goal (maintain, lose, or gain weight).
