## How It Works

1. **Topic & Question Selection**  
   Users select a topic from the dropdown and then choose a related question. The corresponding answer appears below.

2. **Self-Test Mode**  
   Users can write their answer and receive feedback based on keyword matching logic.

3. **Keyword-Based Scoring**  
   The score is calculated by comparing the user's input with expected keywords related to the selected question.
